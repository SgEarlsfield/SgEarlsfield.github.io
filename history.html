        <h2>Parish History</h2>
         <p>Our parish of Earlsfield has always had a fluctuating population, the parish was
                originally formed because St Thomas's at Wandsworth could not keep track 
                of parishioners constantly on the move searching for work. The first church was 
                enabled by an anonymous benefactor who bought the land and paid for the church 
                and presbytery. The benefactor was later found to be Miss Frances Ellis.</p>

                <p>Our first priest was Fr. Henry Aust-Lawrence brought up to Earlsfield from the 
                peace of Sussex. The Parish was given the patronal name of St. Gregory the 
                Great, as 1904 was the 13th centenary of his death.</p>

                <p>From its  earliest times the financial viability of our parish was in question. In 
                1905 Bishop Amigo stressed the urgent need for the parish to have a Catholic 
                school but the unfortunately one never got built.
                The weekly offering in those early days often amounted to just 10 shillings.</p>

                <p>Fr. Benedict Williamson was our parish priest between 1909 and 1915. 
                He had been a noted architect before his ordination in 1909 and used his
                architectural skills to remodel and enlarge the original church. While at 
                St Gregory's he also attempted to revive the male wing of the Bridgettine
                Order.</p>

                <p>Convents of the Brigettine Sisters exist in many places. The Brigittine monks 
                were well known in England before the Reformation especially at Syon 
                House in Isleworth. Fr. Benedict's attempt to re-establish the Brigettine 
                monks came to a standstill in 1915, partly because of the effects of World 
                War 1. However, where he failed others would succeed. The Brigettine
                 monks were re-established in California in 1976, subsequently moving to 
                Amity in Oregon. </p>

                <p>St Gregorys' then has the distinction of being the only parish in Britain or
                Ireland served by Brigettine monks since the Reformation.</p>

          <p>Between the wars St. Gregory's continued to be poor yet even then the 
                number of children attending Catechism classes reached two hundred.</p>

                <p>Father Benedict's church was bombed twice in 1944 and completely destroyed 
                apart from the sign which now is mounted on our entrance arch.</p>
                
                <p>Our present church dates from 1956</p>
